# 53. Maximum Subarray

### Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

```
Example:

Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

My Solutions
```java
class Solution {

	// The idea is sum up the previous number sum only if it is the previous number sum is positive;
	// actually positivePicker is to sum up the the previous numbers,
	// as long as it is still keep positive, then it will be picked;
	// if it was negative, then it is not suppose to be counted at all;
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int max = nums[0];
		int positivePicker = max;
		for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
			positivePicker = nums[i] + (positivePicker > 0? positivePicker : 0);
			max = Math.max(max, positivePicker);
		}
		return max;
    }
}
```
