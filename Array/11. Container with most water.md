# Container With Most Water

### Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water. Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

```java

class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
	    // initialized the maxArea;
        int maxArea = 0; 
		// set two pointer, left is at 0, right is at the end
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.length - 1;
		// this while loop is going to loop n times, finish at right and left adjcent to each other
        while (right > left) {
			// the area is determined by the shorter height
			// the maxArea = shorter height * right - left ------(the length of bottom line)
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left));
			//always let the longer line stand there, and shorter line move
            if (height[left] > height[right]) {
                right--;
            } else {
                left++;
            }
        }
        return maxArea;        
    }
}
