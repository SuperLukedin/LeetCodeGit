# 14. Longest Commmon Prefix

### Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

```
Example 1:

Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

```
Example 2:

Input: ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```


My Solutions
```java
class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        if(strs == null || strs.length == 0) {
		return "";
		}
		// it does not matter how many strings are in strs
		// use the 1st string in the array as initial prefix
		// it will compare with the second string in strs
		// if prefix is longer than the second string, its length will minus 1 anyway till
		// its length <= the second string's length and common prefix being revealed.
		String prefix = strs[0];
		// start from the second string to compare with prefix(the 1st string)
		int i = 1;
		while (i < strs.length) {
			// comparing if the the 1st string prefix is the substring of the second string 
			// if true, indexOf(string) return the beginning index in the second string;
			// since we are looking for prefix, only substring start from beginning returns 0!
			while (strs[i].indexOf(prefix) != 0) {
				// if prefix is still not the substring that start from the 1st letter, prefix reduce the last character
				prefix = prefix.substring(0, (prefix.length() - 1));
			}
			// if prefix is found btw 1st and 2nd string, continue to the third string,
			// compare the third string with remaing character in prefix
			i++;
		}
		return prefix;
		
    }
}

```
