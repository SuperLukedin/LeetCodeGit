# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

### Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.


```
Example 1:

Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Note: "aba" is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

Input: "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```

My Solutions
```java
class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
		// start and end are used to mark down the longest length (end - start)
        int start = 0, end = 0;
		// i is the pointer, which desinated as a center in the expandAroundCenter, starting from 0
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
			// len1 is in case of the longest palindrome is odd number, expand from a single center pointer
            int len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i);
			// len2 is in case of the longest palindrome is even number, expand from two center pointer
            int len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1);
			// detect the answer is odd or even number
            int len = Math.max(len1, len2);
			// end-start = 0 at beginning. later it increases as pointer i moving along the s string.
            if (len > end - start) {
				// i is the center, get start index through:
                start = i - (len - 1) / 2;
				// i is the center, get end index through:
                end = i + len / 2;
            }
        }
		// dont know why end + 1
        return s.substring(start, end + 1);
    }
    
    public int expandAroundCenter(String s, int L, int R) {
	// expand from center, for detecting odd answer, L and R start from the same index
	// for detecting even answer, L and R start in two different index
        while (L >= 0 && R < s.length() && s.charAt(L) == s.charAt(R)) {
            L--;
            R++;
        }
		// retrieve the length
        return R - L - 1;
    }
}
```
