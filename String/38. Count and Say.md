# 38. Count and Say

### The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
1 is read off as "one 1" or 11.
11 is read off as "two 1s" or 21.
21 is read off as "one 2, then one 1" or 1211.

Given an integer n, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.
```

```
Example 1:

Input: 1
Output: "1"
Example 2:

Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```


My Solutions
```java
class Solution {
    public String countAndSay(int n) {
	// the default starting string is "1";
	// the default starting number is "1"; There is no i = 0.
        String result = "1";
        int i = 1;
		
	// Since i start from 1, it is actually executing the second line
	// So i < n not i <= n. When n = 3, it is actually executing the 4th line
	
        while (i < n) {
		
	// The intuition is essentially append count value and current number that is being pointed to a string.
	// Use StringBuilder is more efficient and convenient
            int count = 0;
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
			
	// We have to initialize the c pointing at 1, the first char of the string of result
            char c = result.charAt(0);
			
	// The for loop is traverse the result from char to char
            for (int j = 0; j <= result.length(); j++) {
                if (j != result.length() && result.charAt(j) == c) {
                    count++; 			// if the char keeps the same, increase the counter then go next loop
                } else { 				// if number (c) changes, append the count value and current number that is being pointed to sb.
                    sb.append(count);
                    sb.append(c);       
                    if (j != result.length()) { // if no more characters, then finish the for loop.
                        c = result.charAt(j);   // if pointed at a new Character, then initialize c with the new Character and counter back to 1;
                        count = 1;
                    }
                }
            }
			// after each while loop, update sb to result.
            result = sb.toString();
            i++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
